# PipeLine

Relay messages to multiple Discord channels.

# To Host 

First of all, install Elixir and Mix.

Once completed, create a `config/config.exs` shown in the config section.

```bash
# fetch deps
mix deps.get

# setup the sqlite3 database
mix ecto.create
mix ecto.migrate
```

After that, PipeLine is ready.

```bash 
mix run --no-halt
# or 
iex -S mix
```

# Manual 

The bot's prefix is `>!`. Execute `>! help` and `>! info` for the manual.

To register admin, run `PipeLine.Commands.Admin.register_admin_iex("userid")` in
iex to do just that. `PipeLine.Commands.Admin.delete_admin_iex("userid")` exists
in case you regret your decision.

# Config 

We do not include a `config/config.exs` due to the inclusion of a token.

Use the below as an starting point.

```elixir

import Config

config :nostrum,
  token: "token",
  gateway_intents: :all

config :logger,
  level: :info

config :pipe_line,
  ecto_repos: [PipeLine.Database.Repo]

config :pipe_line, PipeLine.Database.Repo, database: "./database.db"

# whitelist of bots that gets their messages relayed
config :pipe_line,
  allowed_bots: ["1053015370115588147"]

# config the cache size to prevent excessive memory usage  

# influence how many messages can be edited and deleted
config :pipe_line,
  max_msg_cache_size: 500

# change how frequently channel activity is decayed (the more channels tracked, the lower this should be, to save memory)
config :pipe_line,
  activity_decay_ms: 30 * 1000

# influence how many messages which it's author's id can be queried `>! getowner` command
config :pipe_line,
  max_owner_cache_size: 500

# influence the `>! rules` command
config :pipe_line,
  rules: [
    "use common sense"
  ]

# censor the words below
config :pipe_line,
  blacklist: ~w[
skibidi
bussin 
fanum
gyatt
rizz 
]

# config hammer for rate limit
# for advanced hosts only
config :hammer,
  backend: {Hammer.Backend.ETS, [expiry_ms: 60_000 * 60 * 4, cleanup_interval_ms: 60_000 * 10]}
```
